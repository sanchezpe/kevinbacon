# Web Programming Step by Step 
## Assignment: Kevin Bacon
### Description
This assignment asks you to interact with relational databases in PHP using SQL.

The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a game based upon the theory that every actor can be connected to actor Kevin Bacon by a chain of movies no more than 6 in length. (Most, but not all, can reach him in 6 steps. 12% of all actors cannot reach him at all.)

Your task for this assignment is to write the HTML and PHP code for a web site called MyMDb that mimics part of the popular IMDb movie database site. Your site will show the movies in which another actor has appeared with Kevin Bacon. The site will also show a list of all movies in which the other actor has appeared.

The front search page mymdb.php has a form where the user can type an actor's name. When the form is submitted, the results are shown on search.php. You will turn in the following files:

* **mymdb.php**, the front signup page (partial skeleton provided)
* **bacon.css**, the CSS styles for both pages
* **bacon.js** the JavaScript code for both pages
* **search.php**, the search results page
* **common.php**, any common code that is shared between pages
